  <p>
    An logical questionnarie app using <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a> as a static-site
    generator (SSG). The project is purposed for a very specific requirement, which is focusing
    on building logical feature like <a href="https://www.typeform.com/pricing/">the Logic Jumps
    on Typeform</a>, but with further specifications beyond the Typeform's usecase. And this
    repository includes only the front-end code.
